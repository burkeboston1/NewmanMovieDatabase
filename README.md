What's New
-----------
Version 1.0 (pending)
  * Search: users can search for titles, actors, directors, etc. and get a list of matching movies. 
  * Movie Details: OMDB provides extra details (plot, poster, etc.) about movies that Newman doesn't store.

Background
-----------
In the summer of 2016, I (Boston) had no access to the internet. 
To supplement Netflix, I started checking out movies from Newman Library at Virginia Tech where I am a student. 
There were two ways to look for movies:
  1. Use the library's Windows '95 computer to search the database online. 
  2. Flip through the hardcopy of the database, which was a giant white binder sitting on top of the stacks. This was quicker. 
  
So we created NMDB, which hopefully will run on an Android tablet where that old binder used to be. 

Performance
------------
The Newman IT guys gave me a dump of their database in an Excel file. It is ugly. Regardless, it contains lots of cool
info about each record including a very ugly title, call number (which patrons need to locate the movie on the shelf), 
and a jumbled mess of directors, actors, production companies, and miscelleneous stuff. 

The search feature searches Newman's records, but gives the user all the data obtained from an OMDB API call.
